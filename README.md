2.	MessageUI.framework
> The Message UI framework provides specialized view controllers for presenting standard composition interfaces for email. 
The MFMailComposeViewController class provides a standard interface for managing, editing, and sending an email message. Use this view controller to display a standard email interface inside your app.
